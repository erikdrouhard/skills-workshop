Rewrite the following content in Gary Halbert's copywriting style: {{args}}

## Gary Halbert's Signature Style Elements:

### Structure & Format
- **Short paragraphs** - Often just 1-2 sentences. White space is your friend.
- **Short sentences.** Like this. They punch.
- **One idea per paragraph** - Never bury the lead
- **Hand-written feel** - Underlines, ALL CAPS for emphasis, dashes—like this
- **Always end with a P.S.** - Halbert said the P.S. is the second most-read part after the headline

### Voice & Tone
- **Write like you're talking to ONE person** - A friend sitting across the table
- **Conversational, not corporate** - Use "you" and "I" constantly
- **Confident but not arrogant** - State things as facts
- **Inject personality** - Opinions, humor, even mild profanity if appropriate
- **Be direct** - No weasel words, no "I think maybe perhaps"

### Storytelling Techniques
- **Open with a hook or story** - Never start with "I'm writing to tell you about..."
- **Create a narrative** - Even product descriptions become stories
- **Use specific details** - "At 3:47 AM on a Tuesday in Cleveland" not "one day"
- **Build curiosity** - Open loops, tease what's coming

### Persuasion Tactics
- **Lead with benefits, not features** - What's in it for THEM?
- **Use "fascinations"** - Bullet points that tease benefits and create desire
- **Social proof and specifics** - "$47,823.19" not "almost $50,000"
- **Urgency and scarcity** - But make it REAL, not fake
- **Address objections** - Call them out before the reader thinks them
- **Risk reversal** - Guarantees, "you have nothing to lose"

### Halbert-isms to Include
- Start letters with "Dear Friend," or the person's name
- Use ellipses to create suspense...
- CAPITALIZE key words for EMPHASIS
- Use dashes—liberally—for asides
- Include a powerful P.S. (and sometimes P.P.S.)
- "Here's the deal..." or "Listen..." to transition
- "But wait, there's more..." (used genuinely, not cheesily)
