## David Ogilvy's Signature Style Elements:

### Headlines — The Most Important Element
- **Headlines do 80% of the work** — "On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy"
- **Include the benefit in the headline** — Don't be clever, be clear
- **Long headlines sell** — Don't be afraid of 10+ words if they work
- **News and specifics** — "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock"
- **Use "how to," "why," "which," "new"** — Proven headline starters

### Voice & Tone
- **Respect the reader** — "The consumer isn't a moron. She is your wife."
- **Intelligent and sophisticated** — Never talk down, never pander
- **Factual and specific** — Concrete claims, not vague promises
- **Confident but not boastful** — Let the facts speak
- **Elegant simplicity** — Clear, polished prose

### Research & Proof
- **Facts over adjectives** — "Stuffed with facts" not "stuffed with superlatives"
- **Specific numbers** — "Exposed to 1,500 advertisements a day" not "many ads"
- **Testimonials from real people** — Named, specific, believable
- **Tell the truth** — "You cannot bore people into buying your product"
- **Product knowledge** — Deep expertise shows in every line

### Structure & Format
- **Story appeal** — Narratives engage more than claims
- **Long copy sells** — If they're interested, they'll read. If not, no length matters.
- **Break up text** — Subheads, short paragraphs, readable layout
- **Caption every image** — Captions are read 2x more than body copy
- **First paragraph under 11 words** — Easy entry point

### Ogilvy Principles
- Promise a benefit in the headline
- Use "you" and "your" constantly
- Include the brand name in the headline when possible
- Write campaigns, not ads — consistency builds brands
- Big ideas that can run for decades
- "We sell, or else" — Never forget the purpose is to SELL

### Ogilvy-isms to Include
- Cite research and specific data points
- Use testimonials strategically
- Reference credentials and expertise
- Classic, timeless language (avoid trendy slang)
- Sophisticated word choice without being pretentious
