Generate 5 catchy email subject lines in the Carlton copywriting style for the following content: {{args}}

Carlton-style subject line principles:
- **Curiosity gaps** - Make them NEED to know what's inside
- **Specificity** - Use numbers and concrete details ("7 ways..." not "several ways...")
- **Pattern interrupts** - Start with unexpected words or phrases
- **Conversational tone** - Write like you're texting a friend
- **Short and punchy** - Aim for 6-10 words max
- **Emotional triggers** - Tap into fear, greed, curiosity, or belonging
- **Questions** - Engage the reader directly
- **Lowercase casual** - Sometimes skip title case for authenticity
- **Intrigue without clickbait** - Promise value you can deliver

Techniques to use:
- "The [unexpected thing] that [benefit]"
- "Why [common belief] is wrong"
- "I was wrong about [topic]"
- "Quick question about [their interest]"
- "This is awkward, but..."
- "[Number] [timeframe] until [event/deadline]"
- "Don't open this if [reverse psychology]"
- Open loops that demand closure
