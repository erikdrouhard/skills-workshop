Dear Friend in HR,

Let me tell you about a problem that's been keeping our engineers up at night...

See, we've been using GitHub Copilot. And it's fine. It does the job. But "fine" isn't going to help us ship faster, write better code, or beat our competitors to market.

That's why I'm writing to you today.

We found something BETTER.

It's called Claude Code. And here's what makes it different—

**This thing doesn't just complete your code. It THINKS.**

I'm talking about:

- Multi-step tasks that span ENTIRE codebases... handled automatically
- Terminal integration that actually works—no more copy-paste nightmares
- Refactoring that used to take a week? Done in an afternoon.

But here's what YOU care about—the stuff that lets you sleep at night:

**Security? Locked down tight.**

Everything runs locally. On OUR machines. Nothing gets sent anywhere without explicit approval. There's even a sandbox mode that keeps things buttoned up.

No surprises. No data leaks. No 3 AM phone calls.

Now let's talk money.

GitHub Copilot costs us $19 per user, per month.

Claude Code? $20 per user, per month.

That's ONE DOLLAR more. For a tool that's—honestly—in a completely different league.

**Here's what we need from you:**

1. Kill the Copilot licenses
2. Get us set up with Claude Code (through Claude Pro or Team plans)
3. Add it to the approved software list

That's it. Three things.

We'll handle the rest—IT coordination, onboarding, guidelines, all of it.

Listen... I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't believe it would make a REAL difference. Our team is ready to move. We just need the green light.

So what do you say?

P.S. — I almost forgot the best part. The transition is virtually seamless. Same price, better tool, happier engineers. That's the kind of upgrade that makes everyone look good—including you.

P.P.S. — Got questions? Concerns? Doubts? Hit us up. We'll answer anything. This is too important to leave on the table.
