# Request for Approval: Transition from GitHub Copilot to Claude Code

**To:** Human Resources
**From:** Engineering Team
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Subject:** Software Tool Change Request - AI Coding Assistant

---

## Summary

We are requesting approval to transition our AI-assisted development tooling from GitHub Copilot to Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool). This change will improve our development workflows while maintaining compliance with company software policies.

## Background

Our engineering team currently uses GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted code completion. After evaluating alternatives, we have identified Claude Code as a more capable solution for our needs.

## Rationale for Change

**Enhanced Capabilities**
- Agentic coding support for multi-step tasks spanning files and systems
- Native terminal integration with persistent shell sessions
- Built-in support for complex refactoring and codebase exploration

**Workflow Improvements**
- Direct integration with version control operations
- Structured task management and planning capabilities
- Support for multi-file edits with contextual awareness

**Security Considerations**
- Claude Code operates locally via CLI with explicit user approval for actions
- No automatic code transmission without user consent
- Configurable sandbox mode for command execution

## Requested Action

We request HR approval to:

1. Discontinue GitHub Copilot licenses for the engineering team
2. Procure Claude Code licenses (via Anthropic's Claude Pro or Team plans)
3. Update the approved software list to include Claude Code

## Cost Impact

- GitHub Copilot: $19/user/month (Business tier)
- Claude Code: Included with Claude Pro ($20/user/month) or Team plans

Net cost change is minimal, with comparable per-user pricing.

## Next Steps

Upon approval, we will:
1. Coordinate with IT to provision accounts
2. Conduct team onboarding sessions
3. Establish usage guidelines aligned with company policies

Please contact us with any questions or if additional information is needed.
