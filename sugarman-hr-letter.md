# A Strange Request from Your Engineering Team

I need to tell you something.

It's about money. Specifically, about asking you to spend more of it. Ten times more, actually. And I know how that sounds.

But stay with me for a moment.

Because what I'm about to share changed how I think about developer productivity. And once you see the math—the real math—you might feel the same way.

Here's what happened.

We've been using GitHub Copilot. Nineteen dollars a month per developer. It autocompletes our code. Suggests the next line. Helpful? Sure. Revolutionary? Not even close.

Then we discovered Claude Max.

Two hundred dollars a month.

I know. I had the same reaction you're having right now. "Two hundred dollars? For a coding tool? That's insane."

But here's the thing...

Our developers cost the company about seventy-five dollars an hour. Fully loaded—salary, benefits, overhead, all of it. That's real money walking around the building every day.

Now, what if I told you Claude Max saves each developer five to ten hours every single week?

Let's do the math together.

Five hours times seventy-five dollars equals three hundred and seventy-five dollars. Per week. Per developer. That's over fifteen hundred dollars in productivity gains every month.

The tool costs two hundred.

You're not spending money. You're printing it.

But wait—it gets better.

This isn't just faster autocomplete. Claude Max actually *thinks*. It handles entire projects. Refactors codebases. Writes tests. Debugs problems that would take us hours to solve manually.

It's like having a senior developer working alongside each person on the team. One that never gets tired. Never takes vacation. Never asks for a raise.

And the security? Locked down tight.

Everything runs locally on our machines. Every action requires explicit approval. Nothing leaves without consent. Your security team will love it.

Now here's what I'm asking...

Three simple things:

1. Cancel our Copilot licenses
2. Get us Claude Max subscriptions
3. Add it to the approved software list

That's it.

But I understand if you're skeptical. I would be too.

So here's my proposal: Let us run a pilot. Three developers. Ninety days. We'll track everything—hours saved, code shipped, bugs fixed.

Total cost of the experiment? Five hundred and forty-three dollars.

If it doesn't work, we go back to Copilot and you've spent less than the cost of a nice team lunch.

If it does work? You'll have stumbled onto something that changes how your entire engineering team operates.

Either way, you win.

So what do you say?

*The Engineering Team*

P.S. — I almost forgot to mention the most surprising part. The developers who've tested this don't want to go back. They say it feels like coding with a superpower. That's not marketing speak—that's what they actually told me. Worth considering, isn't it?

**Sugarman techniques used:**
- **Slippery slide opening** — "I need to tell you something." (6 words, impossible not to read the next line)
- **Curiosity seeds** — "what I'm about to share changed how I think..." / "But here's the thing..."
- **Emotional hook → logical justification** — Started with the shock of 10x price, then methodically proved the ROI
- **Conversational math** — Walked through the calculation together, making it feel like a shared discovery
- **Story structure** — Narrative arc from problem → discovery → solution → proposal

**The slippery slide:** Opens with "I need to tell you something." — a sentence so short and intriguing you can't help but continue. Then immediately acknowledges the awkwardness ("It's about money... ten times more") which builds trust and curiosity. Each paragraph ends with a hook pulling you into the next.

**Curiosity seeds:**
- "But stay with me for a moment..."
- "Here's what happened."
- "But here's the thing..."
- "But wait—it gets better."
- "I almost forgot to mention the most surprising part."
